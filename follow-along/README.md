## Milestone 2: Frontend - Login Page

In this milestone, I focused on creating the frontend for the login page. I structured the application by setting up a `components` folder where I created the `Login.jsx` component. Additionally, I organized the layout by creating a `pages` folder, which includes `Home.jsx`, `Login.jsx`, and `Navbar.jsx` components. These components work together to provide a seamless user experience, with a functional and visually clean login page for the e-commerce platform.


## Setup and Installation

To get started with the project locally:

### 1. Clone the repository

utils : Utility folder with miscellaneous utilities utility functions in the app.
- +2. Configuring the Server
The Node.js server was generated by using Express and was setup to listen at a different port.
API routes for the application in order to handle different kinds of requests types like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE
