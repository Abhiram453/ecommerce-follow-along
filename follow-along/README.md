## Milestone 2: Frontend - Login Page

In this milestone, I focused on creating the frontend for the login page. I structured the application by setting up a `components` folder where I created the `Login.jsx` component. Additionally, I organized the layout by creating a `pages` folder, which includes `Home.jsx`, `Login.jsx`, and `Navbar.jsx` components. These components work together to provide a seamless user experience, with a functional and visually clean login page for the e-commerce platform.


## Setup and Installation

To get started with the project locally:

### 1. Clone the repository

In Milestone 2, we've moved the e-commerce application to the next level. Having completed Milestone 1, we have focused on structuring the project, setting up both the frontend and backend environments, and building the first user-facing feature ‚Äì the Login Page. In this milestone, we ensure the project is structured and organized for what features will come in.

Learning Goals ????
We have for the end of this milestone

Implemented project file organisation, making sure everything is organized and in place in the project
Set up a React frontend app to do the UI layout
Configured a Node.js server for our backend, that will be prepared for API handling
Integrated Tailwind CSS and used utility classes to make things easier with respect to styling classes.
Developed a functional/styled Login page for the front end, thereby ensuring a smoothen experience for the end user.
Feature Implemented????Ô∏è
- +1.Project Folder Structure.
frontend: Holds all files relating to React.
backend: Has the Node.js server and subsequent API files
- +2. Setup of React Frontend
Activated the frontend by using React to create dynamic UIs
Installed dependencies like React Router for routing
- +3. Setup of Node.js Backend
Activated a minimal Node.js server with Express for subsequent API requests
- +4. Tailwind CSS Setup
Activated Tailwind CSS to make styling of the applications look a lot cleaner and more modern in nature and response.
Installed PostCSS for maximum comfort with developing using Tailwind CSS.
- +5. Building Login Page
Logged-in Page has been designed as the initial functionality of the e-commerce platform.
It was made using Tailwind CSS so it has an incredibly clean design with modern style
Basic fields included were Email, Password fields with a submit button.
Has potential to implement new functionalities (in this case authentication).

# mile stone 3
In Milestone 3, we have actually taken the following big step on our e-commerce application. This is the stage where we would set up a backend, make it talk with a MongoDB, and handle potential errors, as we had set up our frontend in earlier milestones. Now, this stage will ensure your application has good grounds to build on with your backend supporting any API requests made and data managing.

Learning Outcomes???
What we have for ourselves by completing this milestone include:

Organized the backend code into dedicated folders for a better structure and scalability.
Set up a Node.js server using Express to deal with API requests.
Connected to MongoDB for managing data efficiently.
Implemented basic error handling to smooth out server operations.
Updated the README for our achievement in this milestone.
Key Features Implemented????Ô∏è
- +1. Backend Folder Structure
We have set up a well-structured folder for the organization of different parts of the backend.
routes : Different API endpoints and their routes
controllers : Contains the business logic of the routes
models : Defines the models used in MongoDB
middleware : Every middleware function, including authentication and validation, goes inside this folder.
utils : Utility folder with miscellaneous utilities utility functions in the app.
- +2. Configuring the Server
The Node.js server was generated by using Express and was setup to listen at a different port.
API routes for the application in order to handle different kinds of requests types like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE
- +3. Database Connection
I included MongoDB to hold data such as products, users, and orders
Connected Node.js server using Mongoose with the MongoDB database for managing information.
Confirmed that the backend server is correctly connected with the MongoDB database.
- +4. Error Handling
Put in some elementary error handling which, in the event of some errors with the API calls returns meaningful messages to users and developers to debug from easily.
# Milestone 4: User Model, Controller, and File Upload with Multer
Progress Summary
User Model: Created to store user data using Mongoose.

User Controller: Developed to manage user-related operations.

Multer Configuration: Set up to handle file uploads.

Routes: Updated to include endpoints for user operations and file uploads.

# Milestone 5:
Purpose of the Sign-Up Page
The Sign-Up Page provides a user-friendly interface for new users to create an account by entering their Name, Email, and Password. It ensures data integrity and enhances user experience by validating inputs before submission.

Changes in JavaScript for Form Validation
Email Validation: Checks if the email is correctly formatted.

Password Validation: Ensures the password is at least 8 characters long.

Preventing Form Submission: Stops form submission and displays error messages if validation fails, allowing users to correct mistakes.

# Milestone 6:
1. User Signup and Activation Routes
- **File**: `controllers/userRoute.js`
- **Changes**:
  - Implemented the `/signup` route to handle user registration.
  - Added password hashing using `bcrypt`.
  - Generated JWT tokens for account activation.
  - Sent activation emails using the `sendmail` utility.
  - Added the `/activation/:token` route to handle account activation via token verification.

#### 2. Email Sending Utility
- **File**: `utils/mailer.js`
- **Changes**:
  - Configured `nodemailer` to send emails using environment variables for SMTP credentials.
  - Created the `sendmail` function to send activation emails.

  ## Milestone 7: User Login Endpoint and Password Validation

### 1. User Login Endpoint
- **File**: `controllers/userRoute.js`
- **Changes**:
  - Implemented the `/login` route to handle user login.
  - Accepted user credentials (email and password).
  - Retrieved the corresponding user from the database.
  - Validated the password using `bcrypt`.
  - Generated JWT tokens for authenticated users.


# Milestone 8: Product Card Component and Homepage Layout
In this milestone, we focused on creating a reusable product card component and designing the homepage layout to display multiple product cards neatly. This milestone enhances the user experience by showcasing products effectively and maintaining a clean and organized layout.

1. Product Card Component
File: components/ProductCard.jsx
Changes:
Designed a reusable card component that accepts product details as props (e.g., name, image, description, price).
Implemented the card component with a visually appealing design using Tailwind CSS.
Added functionality to handle actions such as "More Info" and "Add to Cart".
2. Homepage Layout
File: pages/Home.jsx
Changes:
Set up a grid layout using Tailwind CSS to display multiple product cards neatly.
Integrated the ProductPage component to fetch and display products from the backend.
Ensured the layout is responsive and maintains a consistent design across different screen sizes.
3. Product Page Component
File: pages/ProductPage.jsx
Changes:
Created a ProductPage component to fetch product data from the backend.
Used the ProductCard component to render each product in a grid layout.
Implemented state management to handle product data and cart functionality.
# Milestone 9: Product Form Creation
In this milestone, we focused on creating a form to input all the details of a product. This form allows users to upload multiple product images and input various product details, which will eventually be saved in the database and displayed on the products homepage created in the previous milestone.

1. Product Form Component
File: pages/CreateProduct.jsx
Changes:

1. Product Schema
File: models/productModel.js
Changes:
Defined the structure of product data using Mongoose.
Ensured each field has proper validation (e.g., required fields, correct data types).
Fields included: name, description, category, tags, price, stock, images, and email.
2. Endpoint Creation
File: controllers/productRoute.js
Changes:
Built a POST endpoint to receive product data.
